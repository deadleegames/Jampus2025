To Puppet, my greatest accomplishment, my only friend, my personal servant, my greatest disappointment, my ultimate fear, et cetera, et cetera,

If you're hearing this, it means that my body has been destroyed. No doubt by that madman across the street. I know, very sad. But fear not, Puppet, for in my genius, I foresaw this eventuality years ago and set a plan in motion, the culmination of which will be my rebirth and the [with rising intensity and derangement] DAWN OF MY IMMORTALITY! STEIN WILL RUE THE DAY HE CROSSED PATHS WITH ME, THE ONLY NON-MAD SCIENTIST IN THE LAND, PROFESSOR ALFRED STRANGE! AND I WILL CRUSH THE... [losing steam] the... oh, topic at hand.

Unfortunately, if you're hearing this, it also means we still have work to do. I have yet to be able to procure the last few ingredients to restore my former self, so you're going to need to run some errands for me, Puppet. Nothing too serious; I'm sure I could have done it myself when I was alive, but you /will/ need to break into Doctor Stein's little shack over there and grab some things. He won't miss them. I mean, these treasures are wasted on anyone but a sane, first-rate scientist, so just drop in, grab the supplies, and reel yourself out of there unnoticed. 

We're still missing a... ah, let's see [paper being loudly uncrumpled]:
* One Tome of the Damned, first edition (hardcover)
* One Tortured Soul Jar, full
* One Vital Essence Siphon

Pretty standard stuff. So, just bring that back here, hook it up to the cloning tank, flip the lever, and we should be good to go!
